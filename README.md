### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± My name is Mingfei Shi, a MS student studying in Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU).

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on generative models, such as diffusion models and GAN models; improve
the framework of diffusion models via maths and use diffusion models into the image editing field, 
aiming at CVPR (2023.11) and ICML (2024.1)
